# Unidirectional-Coupling
Here is the Python3 code to implement ESN architecture described in article "Learning unidirectional coupling using an echo-state network" (https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.107.064205).

The code given here represents only a spefic case, and may require necessary changes to produce different results.
